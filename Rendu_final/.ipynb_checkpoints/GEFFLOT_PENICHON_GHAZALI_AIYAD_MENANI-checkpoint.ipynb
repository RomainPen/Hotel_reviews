    "Les NLP (Natural Language Processing) ou le traitement automatique du langage naturel, sont une branche de l'intelligence artificielle qui consiste à permettre aux ordinateurs de comprendre, de générer et d'interagir avec le langage humain. Cela inclut la reconnaissance de la parole, la traduction automatique, la compréhension de textes et l'analyse de sentiments. Il s'agit d'une tâche complexe, car le langage humain est riche et ambigu, et peut varier considérablement selon le contexte et la culture. Les NLP sont utilisées dans de nombreux domaines, tels que la recherche sur le web, la messagerie instantanée, la reconnaissance vocale de commandes et la création de chatbots. Les NLP reposent sur des algorithmes et des modèles de machine learning ou deep learning pour comprendre et traiter le langage humain."

    "Voici quelques étapes clés dans l'histoire et l'évolution des techniques de NLP :\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1950-1960** : les premiers travaux sur la traduction automatique sont menés, notamment par le linguiste et informaticien Warren Weaver. Des approches basées sur des règles sont utilisées pour traduire des phrases simples d'une langue à l'autre.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1960-1970** : de nouvelles méthodes de TAL sont développées, notamment la reconnaissance de la parole et la compréhension de texte. Des approches statistiques commencent également à être utilisées, permettant d'apprendre à partir de données annotées plutôt que de règles prédéfinies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1970-1980** : développement de la génération de texte et la reconnaissance d'émotions dans le discours. Des modèles probabilistes commencent à être utilisés pour la reconnaissance de la parole et la traduction automatique.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1980-1990** : de nouvelles approches statistiques sont développées pour la traduction automatique, notamment les modèles de langue source-cible et les modèles de mots latents. Des progrès importants sont également réalisés dans la reconnaissance de la parole et la compréhension de texte.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1990-2000** : de nouvelles approches de traitement du langage naturel sont développées, notamment les réseaux de neurones et les approches basées sur l'apprentissage automatique. Ces approches permettent de traiter des données de manière plus efficace et de meilleures performances que les approches statistiques précédentes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2000-2010** : les approches basées sur l'apprentissage automatique connaissent un développement important et sont utilisées dans de nombreuses applications de NLP, notamment la traduction automatique, la reconnaissance de la parole et la compréhension de texte. Des approches de traitement du langage naturel sont également développées pour des tâches telles que la reconnaissance d'entités nommées et la catégorisation de documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2010-aujourd'hui** : Au cours de la dernière décennie, les techniques de traitement du langage naturel ont connu un développement important et ont été utilisées dans de nombreuses applications pratiques.\n",
    "    - L'utilisation de modèles de langage pré-entraînés : ces modèles sont entraînés sur de grandes quantités de données et peuvent être utilisés pour différentes tâches de NLP sans nécessiter de nouvel entraînement. Ils ont permis de réaliser des progrès importants dans des tâches telles que la reconnaissance d'entités nommées, la génération de texte et la compréhension de texte.\n",
    "    - L'utilisation de données de grande taille et de grande qualité : l'amélioration de la qualité et de la quantité de donnée disponible a permis de développer des modèles de NLP plus précis. Cela a été rendu possible notamment grâce à l'apparition de grandes bases de données annotées, telles que celles proposées par Google et Microsoft.\n",
    "    - L'utilisation de techniques d'apprentissage automatique avancées : les techniques d'apprentissage automatique ont connu un développement important ces dernières années et ont été utilisées pour résoudre de nombreuses tâches de NLP. Par exemple, les réseaux de neurones profonds (Deep Neural Networks, DNN) ont été utilisés avec succès pour la traduction automatique et la reconnaissance de la parole. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - L'intégration des NLP dans de nombreux domaines d'application : les techniques de NLP ont été utilisées dans de nombreux domaines, notamment la recherche d'emploi, la publicité en ligne, la création de chatbots et l'analyse de données de réseaux sociaux. Elles ont également été utilisées pour améliorer l'accessibilité des technologies, par exemple en permettant à des personnes sourdes ou malentendantes de communiquer avec des personnes entendantes grâce à la traduction automatique en langue des signes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enfin, il existe de nombreuses autres approches pour le traitement du langage naturel, qui incluent l'analyse syntaxique, l'analyse sémantique, la génération de texte et la reconnaissance de l'intention de l'utilisateur. Ces approches peuvent être utilisées seules ou combinées de différentes manières pour résoudre des tâches spécifiques de NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "En résumé, le traitement du langage naturel est un domaine en constante évolution qui a fait de nombreux progrès ces dernières années grâce à l'utilisation de grandes quantités de données et de puissance de calcul, ainsi qu'à l'adoption de techniques d'apprentissage automatique avancées. Il reste cependant encore beaucoup de travail à faire pour parvenir à une compréhension complète du langage humain et pour permettre aux ordinateurs de le traiter efficacement."

    "Dans cette partie on parlera des différentes techniques utilisées typiquement dans un projet de NLP. Cependant avant d'entamer cette partie nous allons introduire l'étape de pre-processing qui est une étape essentielle afin d'exploiter les données.\n",
    "\n",
    "Le traitement du langage naturel implique souvent l'utilisation de techniques de prétraitement pour transformer les données textuelles en un format utilisable par l'ordinateur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Voici quelques techniques couramment utilisées pour le prétraitement des NLP :\n",
    "- **Conversion en minuscules ou en majuscules** : convertir tous les caractères d'un texte en minuscules ou en majuscules.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Suppression de la ponctuation** : suppression de tous les signes de ponctuation d'un texte.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tokenization** : il s'agit du processus de découpage d'un texte en unités plus petites appelées tokens. Ces tokens peuvent être des mots individuels, des phrases ou des symboles.\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Suppression des stop words** : il s'agit du processus de suppression des mots courants qui ne sont pas utiles pour les tâches de NLP, tels que \"le\", \"et\", \"un\", etc. Ces mots sont souvent appelés mots vides ou stop words en anglais.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stemmatization/racinisation** : il s'agit du processus de réduction des mots à leur forme de base, qui est appelée le stem. La stemmatization ramène les mots à leur racine, c'est-à-dire à leur version sans suffixe. Par exemple, le stem du mot \"sauter\" est \"saut\". Cela est utile car cela permet au modèle de reconnaître que \"sauter\" et \"sauts\" sont liés, même s'ils ne sont pas exactement les mêmes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lemmatization** : cela ressemble à la stemmatization, mais au lieu de réduire les mots à leur forme de base, les mots sont réduits à leur forme non conjuguée et non accordée. Par exemple, \"jouons\" et \"garages\" deviennent respectivement \"jouer\" et \"garage\".\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Tagging de la partie du discours** : il s'agit du processus d'identification de la partie du discours de chaque mot dans un texte. Cela est utile car le sens d'un mot peut dépendre de sa partie du discours.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reconnaissance des entités nommées** : il s'agit du processus d'identification et d'extraction des entités nommées (telles que les personnes, les organisations et les lieux) d'un texte.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyse de sentiment : il s'agit du processus de détermination du sentiment (positif, négatif ou neutre) d'un texte.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Traduction** : il s'agit du processus de traduction d'un texte d'une langue à une autre.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ce sont là quelques exemples des techniques couramment utilisées dans le prétraitement en NLP. Les techniques spécifiques utilisées dépendront de la tâche de NLP à effectuer et des ressources disponibles.\n",

    "\n",
    "Il existe plusieurs techniques pour transformer les mots en vecteur en traitement du langage naturel (NLP). Voici quelques exemples :\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Représentation par mot (word embedding)** : il s'agit de représenter chaque mot par un vecteur de nombres. Ces vecteurs sont appris à partir de données de texte et capturent des informations sur la signification des mots et leur utilisation dans différents contextes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Représentation one-hot encoding** : il s'agit de représenter chaque mot par un vecteur de zéros, avec une seule valeur à 1 dans la position correspondant à l'index du mot dans un dictionnaire.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Représentation term-frequency inverse document-frequency (TF-IDF)** : il s'agit de représenter chaque mot par un vecteur qui combine sa fréquence dans un document (term-frequency) et sa rareté dans l'ensemble des documents (inverse document-frequency).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Représentation par n-grammes** : il s'agit de représenter chaque mot par un vecteur qui inclut non seulement le mot lui-même, mais aussi des informations sur les mots qui l'entourent (par exemple, les bigrammes ou trigrammes).\n",
    "\n",

Par exemple, l'utilisation de modèles de transformer pour les NLP est actuellement en vogue et a permis d'atteindre des performances exceptionnelles dans de nombreuses tâches de NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Les modèles de transformer** sont un type de réseau de neurones utilisé en apprentissage profond et en traitement du langage naturel. Ils ont été introduits dans un article de 2017 intitulé \"Attention is All You Need\" et ont rapidement gagné en popularité grâce à leur capacité à atteindre de très bonnes performances dans de nombreuses tâches de NLP.\n",

C'est un modèle de \"transfert de connaissances\" qui a été pré-entraîné sur un grand corpus de textes en utilisant une technique appelée \"masking language modeling\" (MLM). Lorsqu'il est utilisé pour accomplir une tâche spécifique, comme la classification de texte ou la génération de réponses, BERT peut être finement ajusté en utilisant un jeu de données d'entraînement pour la tâche en question. Il est conçu pour prédire une information manquante dans un texte en utilisant le contexte de ce texte. BERT est donc particulièrement utile pour les tâches de classification de texte, comme l'analyse de sentiments, car il peut prendre en compte le sens des mots dans leur contexte et non simplement en se basant sur leur signification individuelle. Contrairement à ses prédécesseurs BERT a une meilleure compréhension du contexte et est donc plus performant sur de nombreuses tâches de traitement du langage naturel."

       " {'text': 'firstly i should say this hotel was not out first choice.  having had a poor experience at ibis in other countries we had made a decision not to stay there again.  we were due to stay at a lovely boutique hotel on the champs elysee but sadly the protesters put paid to that so we were left with a very last minute decision as to where to stay and this seemed like the best of the hotels offered to us.  check in felt difficult having to stand and talk to someone behind a laptop.  this hotel does not have the traditional reception desk.  the decor in reception is very strange. it looks like a forest and gives the interior a dark appearance. given the trees it would have looked better if there was a reception desk to follow the theme through. the rooms are very tiny and basic.  there is no drinks tray and really only a bed and a chair.  the bathrooms are tiny.  a large person will struggle to get in the shower.  in my room the sink leaked and looking at the floor had done for some time but had not been repaired.  our party had booked 2 rooms.  when we went to breakfast on the first morning one room hadn\\'t been booked for breakfast despite this being paid for.  breakfast was a difficult experience.  this is a large hotel and the breakfast area is probably big enough for a fifth of the guests.  some people had to wait a long time for a table.  to get breakfast you have to queue canteen style.  it reminded me of a school dining room.  you had to put your food on a tray and go off in the hope that you found a table.  the whole organisation was poor. the set up didn\\'t flow.  one of my party asked if the white blob in a bowl near the fruit was yogurt.  a member of staff very unhelpfully said \"i don\\'t know\".  this could have had serious implications if someone had eaten it and been allergic to an ingredient.  the bar area was pleasant enough but the seating is dated and not very comfortable.  it spoils what could be a relaxing atmosphere.  we did eat in the restaurant on our first night and the meal was good and reasonably priced.  during our second evening the fire alarm went off.  there were no signs in the rooms to say what to do in the case of an evacuation.  once we got outside we were quickly let back in with no explanation of what the problem had been.  given that most of paris was rioting at the time it would have been good to be reassured it was nothing to do with that.  because i rushed out i forgot my door card.  i went to reception and was just given another with no questions asked.  while it was nice that i didn\\'t have to wait i had never seen the person i spoke to before so i could have been anyone.  a few security checks would have been reassuring.  they could have been letting anyone into the building and given the current climate that is not good.  the next day my pass stopped working a problem that does seem to be common from the number of people i saw at reception making the same request.  while we were sat waiting for our transport to leave the hotel a guest came to complain that her room had not been made up at 4.10pm.  the staff did not apologise and just said it would be done that day then when she walked away laughed about it.  we left our luggage in the lockers available.  when we came to collect it the block we had used had an out of order sign on and would not open.  the staff did not understand the urgency to get the locker open and took some time to find some one with a master key to do this.  customer service is really lacking in this hotel.  we did meet one very nice manager on the sunday morning but other staff were quite dismissive.  none of the staff said good morning at breakfast and were reluctant to help when asked a question.  on a positive note the hotel is ideally located near the metro and within easy walking distance of the eiffel tower.  anyone staying here should only stay for the close proximity to transport routes around the city and be prepared for a very basic stay.  had we known breakfast would be so chaotic we would have booked room only and eaten elsewhere',\n",

       " {'text': 'this is a budget hotel. budget.  hotel. also, it’s paris. lots of things are very expensive there. if you want some sort of elegant place to stay, dig deep in your wallet, because you’re going to pay for it. full disclosure here: i paid $55 a night through a certain website that features james t. kirk. i don’t know why the price offered there was so much lower than it was elsewhere, but i jumped on it. i don’t think i’d have been quite so pleased if i was paying double that, but i went into this knowing it was a budget hotel. what bothers me about some of these reviews is this: you’re on vacation. you’re in paris. did you really come to paris to hang out in your hotel room?  did you travel all this way to a destination many dream of seeing, just hoping to soak in a bubble bath?  or do you only need a place to sleep and take a shower?so yes, the rooms are very small. mind you, this is the case in a lot of places in europe.  it’s just how things are.  yes, the bathroom is tiny. but again, did you come to paris to see a bathroom?  yes, the furnishings in there are kind of low quality — but again, it’s a budget hotel. there’s no fancy soaps, there’s a bottle of shampoo/shower gel. that’s it. it’s a budget hotel. i will say this, though: there’s very little soundproofing in the building, and the doors close loudly.  many people don’t bother closing their doors lightly, so around 9 am every morning, it sounds like someone is blasting artillery outside. again though, it’s a budget hotel. you’ll also get a lot of street noise outside, but it’s paris. i think that’s just how it is, and again, the soundproofing isn’t great. so bring some earplugs, or play some white noise on your phone. don’t let something silly like that spoil your trip.  but i do agree that the lack of a front desk is odd. there’s a strange procedure where you’re greeted by someone who i guess is just forced to stand up all day for no reason, and you’re asked to go sit down at a table and wait your turn. you’re then checked in by someone who stands with a cell phone. i don’t know why they do this — maybe it’s the ibis way?  maybe they think it’s trendy?  i have no idea. i didn’t find it especially bothersome, just strange. look, the rooms are fine. the rooms are clean, the beds are clean. there’s no spiders or anything filthy going on. it’s a small room at a budget hotel. again, if you’re in paris, why are you so worried about what the hotel is like?  it’s clean, it’s safe, there’s multiple metro stops nearby, going on different lines. you can walk to the park near the eiffel tower in about 15 minutes. you can get to most any site you’ll want to visit in about half an hour of walking and rides on the metro. there’s nice restaurants nearby, there’s a laundromat around the corner. there’s little grocery shops if you want to buy some snacks at night. there’s even a domino’s across the street if that’s what you’re craving. i wish people would stop expecting a world-class hotel at a budget price. i wish they wouldn’t expect the same layout and environment they’d get at a hotel in oklahoma city. this is paris. things are different, and isn’t that part of why you’re going on vacation?  to see and experience something different?  i’d recommend this place to just about anyone.',\n",

(on that note, the sink is very tiny, which made for some creative washing techniques.) two towels and a floor mat are provided, as well as a hairdryer.\\n\\nmattress:\\nthe “mattress” is atypical. it’s about three inches think. it sits upon a type of boxspring that adds height and heft. while my husband had no issue with it, mine would slide, and i would wake up with a significant portion of it hanging over the side. at one point my husband worried i would roll off! certainly not the most comfortable thing to sleep on, however, they do provide two extra pillows and a blanket to ease the hardness.\\n\\nairport/flights:\\nit’s not difficult to take the air train to the metro to get to the hotel. many us flights arrive earlier than their check-in time. some folks were directed to lockers where, for a few euro, luggage can be stored while visiting the city. we arrived around noon and were given a room immediately. we had a 7am departure flight (earlier than the metro ran), so we took a taxi to the airport at a cost of 55 euros.\\n\\ncheck-in/staff:\\ninstead of a long central check-in, there are multiple desks positioned in the center of the lobby. we were welcomed by patrick, who was charming and spoke english well. he provided several maps and answered our many questions. the dining staff was mixed — some were pleasant, others not so much. the gentleman who checked us out was professional and called a taxi for us.\\n\\nnoise:\\nthe hotel hosts many tour groups of various ethnicities and backgrounds. as such, you may be staying when there is a group of american teenagers doing whatever it is that american teenagers do! the floors in the room are wooden -- great for cleanliness -- not great for muffling the squeal and laughter of your neighbors. bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper, otherwise you will hate humanity!\\n\\nbreakfast:\\nthe buffet, which costs around 11 euro, was included in my package. hard boiled eggs, fruits, pastries and breads, cheese, various meats, and yogurt, as well as coffee and juice were provided. the restaurant is bright, cheerful and clean.\\n\\nwi-fi:\\nwe stayed here in november, non-peak season, and had no difficulty with the free wi-fi.\\n\\nbottom line:\\nthis hotel was part of an excellent package deal i purchased with gate 1 travel, as such, i have no major complaints. is this a place for a romantic get-away? absolutely not! however, if you are budget-conscious, will only be crashing here between visiting sites, and can wrap your brain around staying in a room that’s the size of an american walk-in closet, you will have a delightful time.',\n",

       " {'text': \"recently spent 4 days in paris and stayed at the ibis. from the gare du nord station we took a number 39 bus straight to cambronne which dropped us at the end of the road to the hotel and cost only €2 each. we had a double room on the 7th floor which was perfectly adequate for the purpose of our stay. clean, towels and bodywash supplied, hairdryer and tv in room (only the news in english) and free wifi. our towels were changed if we left them out and room cleaned and bed made everyday we were there. the hotel has a bar/restaurant and continental breakfast for €10 per person, however there are lots of cafes and restaurants in the local area and a little supermarket shop across the road. for those who can't live without it there is a macdonalds 5 minutes walk away also with free wifi!\\nthe hotel itself is very modern in style, clean and has what you need for a short stay. i did find the atmosphere rather impersonal due to the size and number of guest passing through, but it didn't affect our stay, we just came and went as we pleased, check in (from 2pm) and check out (by 12 midday) very easy.\\nthe hotel is located less than a minutes walk from the nearest metro station cambronne. from here you can get to the eiffel tower district and arc de triomphe district very easily for around €1.90 for a single fare. you can walk to the eiffel tower from the hotel, it takes around a 15 mins, we walked there and found it a very pleasant walk especially in the sunshine! again lots of shops, bars and cafes in the area.\\n\\nthe eiffel tower was a must for our visit. there are two ways to get your ticket, join the huge queue and pay on the door, or pre-book online (recommended) and breeze straight in! the queue varies depending on the time of year, peak season being the busiest. tickets to the 'sommet' cost €17 per adult & €14.50 for 12-24yr olds.\\nbe warned there are alot of street sellers in the area so be prepared to be hassled!\\nit is a great experience and the views are amazing.\\n\\nthe 'batobus' otherwise known as the river bus is €17 per adult for a 1 day hop on hop off pass and €11 euros for 12-24yr olds. it stops at 9 different locations of the city, including the louvre and notre dame, and is a nice way to take in the sights and have a sail down the seine.\\n\\nwe also did a big bus night tour. it cost €22 per person and was a 2 hour audio tour of all the major sights. you pick the bus up from the arc de triomphe and can pay the driver for the ticket as well as pre-book online. it doesn't stop and let you off at each location but the driver is very good at coasting past to give you enough time to take in the sights and get photos! it does stop at the eiffel to take in the twinkling from onboard.\\n\\nfor anyone interested in the palace of versailles this is also worth a visit and very easy to get to from the hotel. you can take the metro from cambronne to bir-hakelm and then change to the rer c yellow line overground train to versailles. it takes around 45mins and costs €7.90 return. when you leave the station you literally walk in a straight line approx 10 mins and can see the palace in the distance.\\nthere were alot of comments about tickets and queues but i can honestly say we didn't have any problem at all. we visited on a saturday, turned up at 0900am, bought our ticket from the ticket office, joined the queue and was inside by 0930am. the tickets cost €25 per adult for access to the palace and gardens. european passport holders under the age of 24yrs are admitted to the palace and gardens for free if the passport is produced, however if you visit on a day when there is a musical fountain show they charge €9 for entry to the gardens but the palace is still free.\\nyou can also buy tickets from the tourist information shop just opposite the train station at the same price. we didn't take a guided tour, preferring to stroll at our own pace. the palace itself is stunning and the gardens are huge! you can hire a golf buggy to get around if you don't fancy walking, not sure how much this was as we didn't enquire.\\n\\noverall the ibis provided everything we needed for a short stay and was in a great location considering the very reasonable price tag for 3 nights. would i stay again, yes.\",\n",

       " {'text': \"this hotel was really nice for paris and the price we paid. it was very close to the eiffel tower, only a few blocks, and there are a lot of good restaurants down the way. the room we had was on the first floor and on the street, so it could get pretty loud with cars and people. the tram also runs down the street, and there are a lot of lights, but the room has blackout curtains, a big plus. it says there is a/c but it wouldn't work, so we had to keep the window open at night because it would get pretty warm, which resulted in a lot of noise and people smoking on the street which kept getting in the room, so request something not on the 1st floor if you can. the bathroom was pretty good, though the shower was very small, barely enough space to turn around. the room had a queen bed but that was all that fit in the room, there wasn't really any space for much of anything else. big perk for our stay in france was that breakfast came with the room and did not have any extra expense! it was a really good breakfast with croissants, cheese, meats, etc. and fresh squeezed orange juice and lots of coffee options! the biggest issue we faced was at check in we paid the city room tax of 9€ in cash and the guy who checked us in didn't record it, so when we checked out and another guy checked us out he said we needed to pay again. fortunately he let us go without paying twice, but remember to get a receipt because they don't seem entirely organized, as it felt like there was a new employee at the front desk every time we passed. don't be discouraged though, it is a really good hotel for the price and it's location to the eiffel tower and metro to get around is key!\",\n",

       " {'text': \"my partner and i recently took my parents for a weekend break to paris and whilst we travel regularly they do not!\\nit was important to me that we had somewhere fairly central yet good value, i was starting to dispair looking at hotels online, some mid range places were charging up to £700 per night however a friend suggested the ibis rue cambronne and we were pleasantly surprised! we normally steer away from ibis having have poor experiences in the past however this place does exactly what it says on the tin!\\nit is very good value - we paid about £135 per room per night and it has all the amenities that you could want however in my opinion the main benefit of this place is the location;\\nthe hotel is situated approx half an hour by cab from the main train station gare de nord (awful place) and will cost between 25 and 50 euros by taxi for four people (we paid both 50e on arrival in a private hire car and 25e on return in a metered cab these seem to be much cheaper than private hire cabs without!) it is also fairly easy and much cheaper to travel to the hotel via the metro, had we not had our luggage and two tired parents we would have taken this option, you can purchase a book of 10 tickets for 13e and it stops in the next street but one to the main hotel entrance (cambronne station) it is also very easy to use although the connecting tunnels were very smelly however once in the metro you were only two minutes walk from most attractions across the city making this hotel an ideal base for exploring particularly as it is much cheaper than many others nearer the a eiffel tower.\\nas with the majority of hotel rooms in the centre of the city these are very small, many previous reviews mentioned this prior to us arriving at the hotel however they really are very small, my husband is 6 foot 2 and struggled to fit in the shower, it was also impossible to dry yourself with the bathroom door shut however the shower although slightly well worn (what can you expect for the price?) was powerful and never seemed to run out of hot water and the hotel provided all in one hair and body shampoo which in my experience is unusual for ibis (not luxurious by any means but it certainty does the job!) towels were replaced daily but were quite thin and small (a bigger selection would have been nice however again not a massive issue) rooms were cleaned daily and were spotless it was also a nice surprise to have independent climate control (again better than i expected for ibis!) which came in really handy on the hot summer evenings.\\ni called ahead to pre book rooms with a view of the eiffel tower and would definitely recommend doing this as i believe from other reviews on here that they have a limited number however it is well worth the effort to get through via the central ibis call centre.\\nalthough the views are amazing (will attempt to upload photos with this review) and it looks as if the tower is just around the corner it is approx 35 mins fast walk which was not ideal for my parents particularly in the heat, i would suggest using the metro once again as this is only a couple of stops.\\ndespite advertising international channels, the only english speaking channel was bbc world news however this was not an issue for us as we didn't visit paris to spend time i'm our hotel room!\\nthe hotel has a small bar that was fairly quiet throughout our stay, we found it reasonably priced (compared to the rest of paris which all seems to be horrendously expensive!) with a fairly good selection of drinks including local beers and champagne, they have a nice outdoor seating area which was very welcome after a long day exploring! food from the bar appeared to be limited to choc bars and pre packed sandwiches however breakfast was pretty good, continental breakfast is not normally my cup of tea (no pun intended!) but this has plenty of choice of breads, cakes, fritata, crepes as well as meat, cheese, fruit and cereal more than enough to choose from and well worth the extra few £s considering the prices for breakfast elsewhere in the city (up to 12e for a coffee and croissant!)\\nthe road behind our room contained several bars and clubs and the window didn't have double glazing so on occasions there was a bit of noise however neither by husband and i or my parents found it particularly intrusive.\\nthe hotel operates a card system into the room which is also required to activate the lift, a small point that we felt provided added security.\\nthere are many cafés and restaurants around the area several of which we tried and were quite impressed with, there is also a couple of pharmacies and corner shops as well as the most amazing bakery in the street behind - worth a visit for a treat!\\nbe advised that should you need to leave your luggage between check out and departure as we did the hotel operates a locker facility, we managed to fit four cases into two small lockers meaning it only cost 6e again not a huge issue considering the overall total paid for the hotel but worth remembering that you may need to hang onto those last few spare euros!\\nover all this hotel is not only a great value for money base to explore paris is also went some way to restoring my faith in the ibis chain, yes the rooms are small and it may be more basic than others in the area but keep in mind how much you are paying! ibis is a budget chain and having visited paris i now realise that i will need any money saved in booking this hotel as it is so expensive across the city! great value i would look to stay again next time i visit paris.\",\n",

(14 euros for 4 nights).\\n\\ni guess the reason for complaints was the difference between floor qualities.\\nwe stayed in 8th floor and the quality was very good.\\n\\nour room also had a eiffel tower view, that view was the best part!\\nas others mentioned the hotel is a 5 minute walk to metro stations (lines 10 and 8 are working, 6 is under construction), there is also a bus line that has a station in cambnronne street (line 82).\\n\\nthere were 3 halal restaurants near the hotel. the one in cambronne street was delicious and clean (6-7 euros for a kebab meal).\\n\\nwhat was bad?\\n.slow wifi\\n.small room and small bathroom!\\n.small bathroom!\",\n",

    "Le modèle **ABSA** est un modèle de traitement du langage naturel qui permet d'extraire les opinions et les sentiments d'un texte en se concentrant sur des aspects spécifiques. Le modèle ABSA analyse donc non seulement les sentiments exprimés dans un texte, mais également sur quel aspect précis du sujet ces sentiments portent. Par exemple, dans notre cas ABSA permet d'analyser les commentaires d'hôtels et permet de déterminer si un commentaire est positif, négatif ou neutre, et peut également fournir des informations sur les aspects de l'hôtel qui sont le plus souvent mentionnés dans les commentaires (par exemple, le confort de la chambre, la qualité de l'alimentation, le service à la clientèle, etc.). Ce modèle peut être utile pour les hôtels qui souhaitent comprendre ce que les clients apprécient ou non de leur établissement et améliorer leur offre en conséquence."

À partir de simples commentaires, nous avons pu faire parler des chiffres, ce qui pourrait être intéressant si l'on cherche à estimer le niveau de satisfaction des clients à travers des chiffres et des statistiques. Ce projet prouve donc que ce n'est pas parce qu'il n'y a pas de chiffre dans une base de données qu'on ne peut pas faire des études statistiques."
